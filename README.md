# Airline Revenue and Occupancy Analysis

## Business Problem
Our airline operates a diverse fleet of aircraft providing high-quality air transportation. Profitability is under pressure due to stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, rising labor costs, and increasing fuel prices. The goal is to increase **occupancy rates** to boost revenue per seat.

## Objectives
- Increase occupancy rate
- Improve pricing strategy
- Enhance customer experience

## Fleet Overview
| Aircraft Code | Number of Seats |
|---------------|----------------|
| 319           | 116            |
| 320           | 140            |
| 321           | 170            |
| 733           | 130            |
| 763           | 222            |
| 773           | 402            |

## Key Insights
- Ticket bookings gradually increased from June 22 to July 7, then stabilized.
- Lower fare prices often correlate with higher occupancy (e.g., aircraft SU9).
- Comfort class is only available on 773; CN1 and CR2 only offer economy.

## Occupancy Rate Analysis
- Occupancy rate = Booked seats ÷ Total seats
- High occupancy increases revenue and reduces cost from empty seats.
- Simulating a 10% occupancy increase shows steady revenue growth.

## Recommendations
1. Optimize pricing strategy based on aircraft type, class, and demand.
2. Focus on underperforming aircraft (e.g., CN1) to improve amenities or pricing.
3. Enhance customer experience through better booking and loyalty programs.
4. Use data-driven insights for scheduling, pricing, and resource allocation.

## Conclusion
Maximizing occupancy rates is critical to improving profitability. By balancing pricing, service quality, and operational efficiency, the airline can increase revenue while maintaining safety and customer satisfaction.
